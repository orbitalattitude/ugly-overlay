# ugly-overlay

## What is this thing?
These files are an overlay to customize a linux install into uglyos
This is designed to be used in conjunction with a particular Suse Studio appliance.

I will be writing more about this soon at http://orbitalattitude.com
I will try to get things settled in for a first release soon. Stay tuned!

## License:
Any original work I have added to this overlay I offer under the GPL V2 
As I write this there are sources included in the overlay from other projects
As far as I am aware these are also available under the same license. 
Please dont hesitate to contact me immediately if you have licensing issues.
