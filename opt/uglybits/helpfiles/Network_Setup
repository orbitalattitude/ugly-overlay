Network_Setup

Many usb-ethernet devices will just work.
They will try to grab DHCP. Some may require
a little work.

To get broadcom wifi working on a lot of modern
Apple machines, we will need to install
broadcom firmware. Unfortunately we cannot
ship this firmware with the OS because of
evil licensing by broadcom. :(

If you have a chipset that works with 
broadcom-wl you can set it up by connecting
through ethernet or a supported wifi dongle.
Just run /opt/uglybits/ugly-net-setup but 
be aware this will reboot after the firmware
is downloaded. Then log in as root and use
'yast' to configure the wifi. 

Hopefully we can improve on wifi config in
the future!
