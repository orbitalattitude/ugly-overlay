Package_Management

uglyOS comes pre-installed 2 package managers
zypper - a command line package manager
yast - a curses menu based system config tool

You will have Suse LEAP repos pre-configured
along with a couple of others that help us
build the OS images. You can of course add
more if you like. 

Yast is useful for a lot more than just basic
package mangement. Both tools are well 
documented on the web.
